# LLM Analysis Reflection

## Q1. Which of the 6 layers surprised you the most in terms of complexity for the product you chose? Why?

**Answer:**

The layer that surprised me the most in terms of complexity was the **Orchestration layer**. I initially thought the product mainly depended on the LLM for generating responses, but I realized that a lot of work happens behind the scenes to manage prompts, context, memory, and tool usage. This layer is responsible for structuring inputs, handling multiple steps, and ensuring the output is relevant and accurate.
What made it more complex was how it coordinates different components like prompt templates, APIs, external tools, and response formatting. It is not just a simple request–response process, but a controlled workflow that improves reliability and user experience. This made me understand that the product’s performance depends as much on orchestration as on the model itself.

## Q2. What was the single biggest difference you noticed between the LLMs you tested?  


**Answer:**

The single biggest difference I noticed was in how each model handled depth and practical understanding, not just the quality of the answer.
Claude stood out because it explained the concept in a more structured and thoughtful way, often adding real-world context and mentioning actual technologies or implementation details. It focused on clarity and completeness, which made the response feel more like expert guidance rather than just a general explanation.
ChatGPT’s biggest strength was speed and balance. It provided quick responses that were clear, well-organized, and sufficiently detailed without being too long. It was efficient and practical, making it useful when I needed fast but reliable information.
Gemini’s main difference was that its responses were more high-level and less descriptive. It often gave shorter explanations with limited technical depth, which made it less helpful for deeper understanding or practical use.
Claude focused on depth and real-world detail, ChatGPT balanced speed and clarity, and Gemini provided more basic, high-level responses.
